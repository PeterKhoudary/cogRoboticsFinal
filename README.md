15-494 S24 final project, by Peter Khoudary and Shruti Srinivasan.

HOW TO RUN:
Given you have a cozmo set and ready, make sure you have an openai key in your environment. Once this is done,
you can interact via terminal using tm messages. You can ask cozmo whatever. If you've asked him for / he's given you a path, type "tm run path" to have him execute it.
