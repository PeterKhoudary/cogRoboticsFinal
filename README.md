15-494 S24 final project, by Peter Khoudary and Shruti Srinivasan.

HOW TO RUN:
Given you have a cozmo setup and ready, make sure you have an openai key in your environment. Once this is done, genfsm DemoFinal.fsm, and run it in simple_cli.
You can interact with cozmo using tm messages, and can ask cozmo whatever. If you ever asked cozmo for a path / he describes a path he could take, you can use "tm run path"
to have him drive the most recent path he suggested.
